### **Project: Swarm Paywall JS Library**

**Objective:** Create a JavaScript library that enables content publishers to create paywalls for their content stored on Swarm, and for consumers to purchase access to that content using NFTs.

---

### **Core Components**

The system will consist of three main components:

1.  **Publisher Library (JS):** A JavaScript library for content publishers to manage their paywalled content.
2.  **Consumer Library (JS):** A JavaScript library for content consumers to purchase and access paywalled content.
3.  **Listener Service (Node.js):** A separate, long-running Node.js service that monitors the blockchain for purchase events and grants access to the content.

---

### **1. Publisher Library (`bee-js` based)**

This library will provide the following APIs for the content publisher:

*   **`createPaywall(content, options)`:**
    *   This function will take the content to be paywalled (either a file or a directory) and upload it to Swarm using `bee-js`.
    *   The content will be encrypted using Swarm's built-in encryption.
    *   It will create a Swarm feed for the content, which will be controlled by an Access Control Trio (ACT). The ACT will initially only grant access to the publisher.
    *   It will deploy a new NFT contract on a compatible blockchain (e.g., Gnosis, Sepolia). This NFT will represent access to the paywalled content.
    *   **Returns:** An object containing the `feedReference`, `nftContractAddress`, and other relevant metadata.

*   **`updatePaywall(feedReference, newContent)`:**
    *   This function will update the content of an existing paywalled feed.
    *   It will use the `FeedWriter` from `bee-js` to update the feed with the new content.
    *   The new content will also be encrypted.
    *   **Returns:** The new `reference` for the updated content.

### **2. Consumer Library (`bee-js` based)**

This library will provide the following APIs for the content consumer:

*   **`purchaseAccess(nftContractAddress)`:**
    *   This function will interact with the NFT contract on the blockchain to purchase an access token.
    *   It will trigger a transaction to mint a new NFT to the consumer's wallet.
    *   **Returns:** The `transactionHash` of the purchase.

*   **`readContent(feedReference, options)`:**
    *   This function will allow a consumer who owns the corresponding NFT to read the content from the Swarm feed.
    *   It will use the `FeedReader` from `bee-js` to download the content.
    *   The library will handle the necessary authentication with the ACT to prove ownership of the NFT and gain access to the content.
    *   **Returns:** The decrypted content.

### **3. Listener Service (Node.js)**

This will be a standalone Node.js process that the publisher must run to manage access to their paywalled content.

*   **Event Monitoring:**
    *   The service will listen for `Transfer` events on the NFT contract.
    *   When a new NFT is minted (i.e., a purchase is made), the service will identify the new owner's address.

*   **Access Granting:**
    *   After a configurable number of block confirmations, the service will update the ACT for the corresponding Swarm feed.
    *   It will add the new owner's address to the list of grantees in the ACT, giving them permission to read the content.

*   **Access Revocation (for subscriptions):**
    *   The service will also handle subscription expiries.
    *   If a subscription is not renewed, the service will remove the user's address from the ACT, revoking their access to future content updates.

---

### **Technical Implementation Details**

*   **Swarm:**
    *   **`bee-js`:** The core library for all Swarm interactions.
    *   **Feeds:** Used to create mutable references to the content.
    *   **Single Owner Chunks (SOCs):** The underlying technology for Feeds, ensuring that only the publisher can update the content.
    *   **Encryption:** All content will be encrypted on the client-side before being uploaded to Swarm.
    *   **Access Control Trio (ACT):** Used to manage permissions for the Swarm feeds.

*   **Blockchain:**
    *   **NFTs:** Used to represent access to the paywalled content.
    *   **Smart Contracts:** A simple NFT contract will be deployed for each piece of paywalled content.
    *   **Events:** The Listener Service will use blockchain events to trigger access control updates.

### **High-Level Workflow**

1.  **Publisher:** Uses the **Publisher Library** to create a paywall for their content. This uploads the encrypted content to Swarm, creates a feed with an ACT, and deploys an NFT contract.
2.  **Consumer:** Uses the **Consumer Library** to purchase an access token by minting an NFT from the contract.
3.  **Listener Service:** Detects the NFT purchase on the blockchain.
4.  **Listener Service:** After a few block confirmations, it updates the ACT on Swarm to grant the consumer's address read access to the feed.
5.  **Consumer:** Uses the **Consumer Library** to read the content from the Swarm feed. `bee-js` will handle the authentication with the ACT.

This architecture provides a decentralized, secure, and automated way to create and manage paywalled content on Swarm.
